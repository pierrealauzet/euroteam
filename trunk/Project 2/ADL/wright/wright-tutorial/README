This distribution is meant to be a self-contained, self-guided demonstration
of the analysis of Wright specifications.  In this distribution, we have
combined a paper introducing Wright with several examples from the paper that
are mechanically checkable.  In the tutorial script included, we will explain
how Wright specifications are checked, what the results look like, and how to
interpret the results.


The following files are contained in this distribution:

  wright-tosem97-revision.ps   A paper containing an introduction to Wright
                               and several small example Wright specifications.

  Wright-tutorial.ps           A script that will walk the reader through a
                               tutorial describing the analysis of Wright
                               specifications using FDR.

  *.wrt                        These are the Wright specifications from the
                               paper encoded in an ASCII representation.

  *.fdr2                       These are the same specifications after being
                               converted to CSP.  There is one .fdr2 file for
                               each .wrt file.

The reader should first read the wright-tosem97-revision.ps paper and then
proceed to the Wright-tutorial.ps paper.  The example specifications are 
provided as reference material.
